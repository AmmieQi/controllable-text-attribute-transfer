# Controllable Unsupervised Text Attribute Transfer

Code for the paper:

	Controllable Unsupervised Text Attribute Transfer via Editing Entangled Latent Representation [Arxiv:1905.12926](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12926)

## Introduction
In this work, we present a controllable unsupervised text attribute transfer framework, which can edit the entangled latent representation instead of modeling attribute and content separately. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first one that can not only control the degree of transfer freely but also perform sentiment transfer over multiple aspects at the same time. 



## Dependencies
	Python3
	Pytorch0.4
